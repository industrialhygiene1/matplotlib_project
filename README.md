# MatPlitLib Project Observations

	#- As would be anticipated, rural areas do not use Uber as much but the fares in rural areas are higher on average
	#- Total fares in urban areas are higher, even though rural areas have higher average fairs, due to the much larger number
	#	of rides
	#- Although it would require more investigation the much lower number of rides in rural areas has led to a much smaller number 
	#	of drivers (an order of magnitude lower) in rural areas.
